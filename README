The intention of this package is to allow Protovis graphics
to be easily generated from within R, transparently.

The initial goal is to use RGraphicsDevice from Omegahat to
implement.

Currently, it is using brew to fill in a template of the example
scatterplot file from http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/ex/dot.html
