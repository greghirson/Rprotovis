# Scatterplot

A scatterplot function should be the same as a lineplot function, just with
a switch for plotting points vs. connected points vs. connected lines.

Plots

* points
* lines
* points and lines

If color is going to be added (as c to the json data), it needs to be added
to the data.frame before the `jsonify()` command is called.
